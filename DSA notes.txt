FEW POINTS --                           (1)  Mulitple algorithmic exist for same problem,    
                                                (2)  same algorithm with same language can be implemented in diff. ways. ,                                                                                                                       |                                              (3)  hwhile writing programs, focus on big picture, rather writing clever code, code should be simple and maintainable. 


Worst case complexity is represnted by big-O notation. 
big-0 time complexity -  It focuses on bigger picture 

time complexity -         
                                   0(n) - Linear 
when there is loop it can be called time complexity as Linear
                                  0(1) - constant
when there a function performs only once it is-   constant

                                0(n^2)- Quadratic
when there is a for loop inside a for loop- Quadratic

                              0(n^3) - Cubic
when there is a for loop inside a for loop which is also in a for loop, it is called - cubic

                            0(logn) - Logarithmic

space complexity -

                         0(1) - constant
                        0(n)- Linear

Objects -         Big- 0

Insert, Remove, access - 0(1)
Search, Objects.Keys(), Objects.values(), Object.entries() - 0(n)

Array - Big-0 

Insert/ remove at end, Access, Push/pop - 0(1)
Insert/remove at beginning, Search, Shift/unshift/concat/slice, splice, ForEach/map/filter/reduce - 0(n)

Math Algorithm-       
1. fibonacci sequence
2. Factorial of a number
3. Prime Number
4.Power of two
5. Recursion
6. Fibonacci sequence with recursion
7.Factorial of a number with recursion.

The approach - 
Problem statement
Pause video to try sovling
implement sol. together.
determine the big-0 of the solution.

Fibonnaci sequence--   0(n)
Factorial of a number --  0(n)

                                                         TREE structure
      nodes that don't have any children are called leaf nodes.
        parents's parents are called ancestors.  
        Path --     between ancestor and child   
        degree of a node is a total no. of child it has.
        degree of a tree is defined by the max. degree a node of that tree has.   
        depth is no. of edges a node has from root.
        height is no. of edges a node has from the lowest node in the tree
